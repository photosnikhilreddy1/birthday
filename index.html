      <p>A windmill turning slow.<br>
      Our first beer.<br>
      Your eyes speaking quietly to mine.<br>
      A comfort I didn’t expect.<br>
      A spark I didn’t understand yet.</p>

      <p>The bike ride after—<br>
      cool air, soft silence, shared space.<br>
      Your hand on my shoulder—warm, gentle, grounding.<br>
      A touch that stayed in my mind long after.</p>

      <p>And somewhere inside,<br>
      a small wish began—<br>
      a simple side hug, someday.</p>

      <p>A tiny beginning.<br>
      A quiet start.<br>
      But it was the start of us.</p>

    <h2>Super Townhouse Oak AECS: 26 June <a href="#"><img src="hotel.jpg" alt="Hotel"></a></h2>
    <div class="poetry">
      <p>The hotel room felt warm and quiet,<br>
      a space filled with nerves, excitement,<br>
      and a gentle pull toward you.</p>

      <p>Your first hug—<br>
      a single moment that opened inside me<br>
      like <b>butterflies waking all at once</b>,<br>
      their soft wings fluttering through my chest,<br>
      making my breath feel warm and weightless.</p>

      <p>Then came our first closeness—<br>
      nervous, tender, slow…<br>
      two unsure hearts stepping into something new,<br>
      learning each other with trembling hands<br>
      but finding comfort in the warmth we shared.<br>
      Nervous, yes—<br>
      but beautifully kind,<br>
      beautifully ours.</p>

      <p>That night felt like a shift—<br>
      a quiet spark,<br>
      a silent confession,<br>
      a feeling that stayed long after.</p>

    <div class="poetry">
      <p>Having you on the cricket field felt unexpectedly tender—<br>
      your presence turning the whole place warm,<br>
      as if the noise faded the moment you looked my way.</p>

      <p>I played with a little extra fire,<br>
      hoping you’d see me, notice me,<br>
      maybe even feel a spark because of me.</p>

      <p>And when I caught you watching—<br>
      that soft, adoring glance you thought I didn’t notice—<br>
      it felt like the sweetest victory,<br>
      the kind that touched my heart more than the game ever could.</p>

    <div class="poetry">
      <p>Restobar lights, cold beer, your warmth closer than ever.</p>
      <p>Parking lot pressed us together, hands exploring, lips devouring.</p>
      <p>Cuddles heavy, breaths tangled, desire spilling over, every touch claiming more.</p>
      <p>Even the small bite that drew blood couldn’t stop the fire between us.</p>
      <p>Across the next two days, the movie date carried our longing further,<br>
      fingers tracing secrets only we could feel.</p>

  <!-- 5. Akoya -->
  <div class="event">
    <h2>Akoya: 6 August <a href="#"><img src="akoya.jpg" alt="Akoya"></a></h2>
    <div class="poetry">
      <p>That day felt charged from the moment we met—<br>
      wine warming us,<br>
      desire flickering in every glance,<br>
      every small touch already pulling us closer.</p>

      <p>Everything between us clicked instantly—<br>
      your closeness, my racing breath,<br>
      our bodies answering each other<br>
      with a hungry, unstoppable honesty.</p>

      <p>The wild moments came fast—<br>
      bold hands, daring kisses,<br>
      a heat that rose and rose<br>
      until it drowned every thought except you.<br>
      The wind only made it crazier,<br>
      turning our closeness into thrill,<br>
      every move sharper, deeper,<br>
      a rush that blew my mind completely.</p>

      <p>And when the storm settled,<br>
      when our breaths finally softened,<br>
      biryani and tender coconut pudding<br>
      felt calm and sweet—<br>
      a soft ending to a day<br>
      that burned beautifully between us.</p>

  <!-- 6. Happy Stays -->

    <h2>Happy Stays: 19 August <a href="#"><img src="happystays.jpg" alt="Happy Stays"></a></h2>
    <div class="poetry">
      <p>Mad, wild, unforgettable sex that left us breathless in the best way.</p>
      <p>And the biryani mix-up, our little hustle to get it back—messy, funny, and somehow perfectly us.</p>

  <!-- 7. Phoenix -->
  <div class="event">
    <h2>Phoenix: 24 August <a href="#"><img src="phoenix.jpg" alt="Phoenix"></a></h2>
    <div class="poetry">
      <p>Parking lot kisses—hot, stolen,<br>
      the kind that spark right through the skin,<br>
      until security’s flashlight found us<br>
      and we broke apart laughing, breathless, guilty, wanting more.</p>

      <p>The movie date carried our longing further,<br>
      fingers tracing secrets only we could feel.</p>

      <p>Triple Schezwan was its own kind of heat—<br>
      spicy, messy, addictive,<br>
      just like us that day.</p>

      <p>And window-shopping through brand stores<br>
      felt strangely intimate—<br>
      your hand brushing mine,<br>
      your eyes catching me,<br>
      desire hiding in every “casual” glance.<br>
      A lusty little adventure,<br>
      sweet, reckless, and perfectly ours.</p>

    <div class="poetry">
      <p>Smirnoff warming our voices,<br>
      our hearts already running too fast for their own good.</p>

      <p>A small fight sparked—<br>
      sharp words, sharper silence—<br>
      but underneath it all was love burning too intensely to hide.</p>

      <p>Your bruised face still breaks me a little—<br>
      I’m sorry for every moment that hurt you,<br>
      every emotion that turned too heavy,<br>
      every feeling that hit harder than it should have.</p>

      <p>But in the middle of that storm,<br>
      the way we held each other afterward—<br>
      quiet, trembling, overflowing—<br>
      said more than apologies ever could.</p>

      wine and vodka nights — everything tastes better with you.</p>

      <p>Manifesting more intimacy, more adventure, more love, more raw moments,<br>
      a lifetime friend, a lifetime fire, a lifetime “us.”</p>

      <p>Manifesting Goa dates for years and decades,<br>
      until these breaths soften… and fade… yet still choose you.</p>

    and the story I want to keep writing —<br>
    again, again, and always.</p>
